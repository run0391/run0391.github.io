      GPS 1.1: Pair Programming

    <div id="body">
      <ul>What is Pair Programming?
        <li>Pair Programming is when two people are working together on the same line of code. </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>Why is Pair Programming important to DBC?
        <li>Pair Programming is important to DBC because it simulates the work environment many students will face at their future careers as web developers. Within a "pair", there is a 'driver' and a 'navigator'. Pair Programming helps both people to learn from each other and develops communication skills between the two partners. Pair Programming also helps reduce the number of mistakes because they are both looking at the same document. Working with a peer also helps both people stay focused on a task, rather than being distracted by surrounding factors. </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>What is a Driver?  What is a Navigator?
        <li>In Pair Programming, there are two roles: a driver and a navigator. </li>

        <li>A driver is the person who is actively typing on the keyboard. He is the one who is making changes in the text editor.</li>
        <li>A navigator is the person who is instructing the driver what to add and change in the text editor. The navigator has the "big picture" overview of the project, while the driver is mainly focused on the instructions of the navigator.  The navigator's role is also to check for errors in syntax and thinking of better ways to structure the code.</li>
