    As the tech world continues to grow, the complexity of the tech world has grown with it.  In the past, a software or website needed to be compatible with your PC or Mac, two very clear options.</p>
    <p>Now, with the vast number of devices that exist, you have both online and mobile versions and then variations within each of those platforms as well.</p>

    <p>Having your software or website be easily accessible across multiple platforms is crucial to a company's success.  Society in general has a very short attention span and if things are inconvenient, inconsistent, or inaccessible the individual will likely leave what they are doing and go to something else. Moreover, if something looks outdated you are also less likely to use it.</p>

    <p>I recently worked for a software company in their technical support.  The software was used for individuals to perform market research, employee engagement, or academic studies.  It was not uncommon for someone to reach out to us because the appearance on a mobile device wasn't quite the same experience as the online version.  They recognized the importance of having a good experience for the user, regardless of what platform they were on.  Often this required them to make changes to the original version.</p>

    <p>I think one solution that companies should use as their approach is to focus their first design on the most difficult platform possible.  If it is compatible with that platform, then it should scale to platforms that have less problems better.</p>

    <p>Another idea that I would hypothesize would be form someone to actually design a software or platform that would translate your code well across platforms.  I recognize this is much easier said than done, but in technology if you can imagine it, anything is possible.</p>
