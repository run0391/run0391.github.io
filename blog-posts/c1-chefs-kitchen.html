    <p>I liked the video and what Shereef had to offer with his insight.  I felt like I was getting vicariously called out from time to time and I appreciated that.</p>
    <p>One of my favorite points is his first one of the experiment versus the consumer.  Can I come in and expect myself to own it and no one else owes me anything else?  Or do I expect everything to be handed to me on a platter?  I agree that so far I expect some of the latter since I am paying for it, but I can see that I will find the most value if I have the attitude of the former.</p>
    <p>I appreciate that DBC is looking to create good value and not simply find revenue.  So far it has been good overall, but sometimes a bit tedious with the writing/reflections. </p>
    <p>I honestly have had some thoughts about having this attitude of I create it and wondering if it is really necessary for me to go to DBC.  Could I do it on my own? Certainly it is possible.  But right now I'm giving DBC a chance because I believe that there is more to it than simply coding knowledge, but that the network and other components offered can assist me in creating the value.</p>
