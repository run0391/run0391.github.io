    <p>All of us face conflict as much as we try to avoid it.  You may have internal conflicts, external with another person, or you may be part of a group that has internal and/or external conflicts.</p>
    <p>Since conflict is inevitable in our lives, it's important to think about how each of us handles conflict.  Do you have any strategies?  Have they been effective or ineffective?  If you don't have a strategy, are your reactions helpful or hurtful?</p>
    <p>In analyzing my own life, I was brought to remember a time when I was a missionary for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (Mormon faith).  As a missionary, I was paired to work with someone that I had never met before.  The first individual I worked with was flexible and we were able to get work done.  The second individual I worked with wasn't as flexible and we had some disagreements about how we should do things.  What was most difficult was it wasn't much of a discussion as much as it was a statement from him and the feeling that was how it was going to be because he said so.</p>
    <p>My typical method of dealing with a conflict like this is avoidance of the person.  However, as a missionary you aren't allowed to separate from the individual you are paired with.  This forced me to have to face the conflict, which was very difficult for me to do.  As I analyze my strategy, I'm surprised to find that I attacked the other individual although very timidly.  I blamed him for the issues that we had but felt pain in doing so.  He didn't seem to sympathize with me in any way and seemed to make me feel worse in my timidness, causing me to feel a degree of self-attack and feeling down based off of what I said and how I treated him.</p>
    <p>While the particular course of action didn't change much for the given situation that I found to be an issue, I think it may have prevented future problems because I voiced my concerns.  Looking back, I don't disagree with the fact that I voiced my concerns, but I'd try to carry a different attitude rather than a timid one.  I suppose one of the more successful ones to "win" an argument are rhetorical questions.</p>
    <p>This sort of attitude, however, I think is condescending to the person.  I think if the rhetorical question is asked in a genuine way then you can try to help the individual see what you are seeing and not feel that you are being condescending towards them.</p>
    <p>As I analyze the experience as a whole, I learned that it's very important in not just what you say, but how you say it.  Also, saying things matter of factly can be better than trying to do a large build up because you can deal with an issue more directly.</p>
    <p>While I'm no expert with conflict, I hope that I can continue to identify how I deal with it and be able to have better control of how I respond to it by using genuine questions.</p>
