    <p>This is the learning style I identified with according to the quiz, and after reading the things that relate to the individual I have to agree with them.</p>

    <p>Some of the things that an Abstract Sequential Learner likes are to analyze a situation before making a decision.  I've found this often and feel that it can be very beneficial for situations that have a lot of edge cases.  This will make sure that the overall architecture of a solution will be be able to handle all of the possible scenarios.</p>

    <p>One thing I also like is being able to work alone.  I think this allows me to feel like I am really grasping an understanding as well as to be able to control the processes at hand.  I think this allows me to be versatile and have an understanding of many components.</p>

    <p>In trying to have a better growth mindset, I am looking to be able grow by truly trying to listen to other's solutions and be able to learn from how they are thinking about processes.  Before I go into analyzing how <i>I</i> think the solution should go, I should listen to their solutions so I can take it into consideration.</p>

    <p>I think I can also grow in trying to address scenarios where there may not be a right or wrong.  I need to be able to feel like the creation meets a need.  To meet a need, I think I will first need to identify my purpose.  Having a clearly defined purpose will allow me to decide if a solution is approaching that or not.</p>

    <p>In summary, I think continuing to be analytical about what I am doing will be a benefit.  If it is not clearly defined, then I think defining a purpose and then working toward that purose will be my best way to approah it.</p>
