    <p>I've paired a fair number of times now, not necessarily more than you're expected but still about 9 times now.  In general I like pairing with people though I don't like having to go through the scheduling of it.  Most of the time I haven't learned anything in particular from the person I paired with, but pairing has made me feel like I'm at a good pace with the curriculum in my learning.  I also like being able to help others when they are struggling.  It's rewarding for me to see that the efforts I have put in have put me on a good track.</p>

    <p>I've only had one time where I was a bit frustrated.  I've done a couple of 3-pair sessions and had one good experience and one sub-par experience.  The sub-par experience was due to poor communication and the three of us being at different levels.  I didn't lose my cool in any way, but sometimes I would tune out and work on my own things.</p>

    <p>After having read my feedback, I'm happy to know that people appreciate pairing with me and I don't have a blindspot in regards to their sentiment.  I've received from two different people that I sometimes go quiet and they don't know what I'm thinking or doing.  I know sometimes I get really focused on solving a problem and lose track of anything else.  I should try to talk through my thought process out loud so I can share with the individual where I am at and they can learn or help me solve the problem more quickly.</p>

    <p>I'm not the best at writing feedback, honestly, because I like being nice.  The other problem is that the one piece of feedback that really seems pertinent would be "learn all of the methods" which is not very actionable or specific as to what they can do.  Also, I feel like a lot of things I could give feedback are a matter of preference more than doing something right or wrong so I don't want to tell someone to change when someone else may say to keep that the same.</p>

    <p>Overall, I like that they have required us to pair early on.  It has created an environment of helping each other and regularly looking to others for assistance and improvement.  I feel like at this point, about 5 weeks in, I wouldn't mind if they removed the requirement and let people continue to peer pair if they would like.  The one downside to peer pairing is it actually can require you to stall to make sure that you get all your pairings in.  I'm reminded how I once heard the No Child Left Behind Act referred to as the No Child Get Ahead Act.  I similarly feel that they are trying to keep everyone together and it actually makes it slightly difficult to get ahead.  I recognize that there are all sorts of outside resources to get ahead, but one of the things that caused me to do this program is I like having structure in front of me that keeps everything cohesive.</p>
