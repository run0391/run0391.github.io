    <p>Stereotypes are something I didn't grow up thinking about too much.  I think a large measure of that is because I grew up in a very homogenous area in terms of religion and race.  In some ways this may make you think that stereotypes are very strong, which I think in some ways they are, but it was also something that I didn't think about or look for very much.</p>
    <p>After listening to a lecture about it, I realized that there are more stereotypes than I think about.  It's almost as if we've stereotyped the word 'stereotype' to think about really negative things and commonly described minorities.  I can now see that stereotypes can be by omission (not degrading a certain group, but building one up) as well as very circumstantial, such as being "the old person" within a certain group of individuals.</p>
    <p>I think one of the hard things about handling our own judgments is we want to feel like we know a lot, but from everything I can gather when you meet someone you have to almost assume that you know nothing like a little child would.  While following stereotypes may help you know information about individuals early on from time to time, when you are wrong it is never fun to have to fight against predefined expectations.</p>
    <p>Some of the stereotypes that I face--being a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (Mormon), being from Utah, or lack of romantic relationships in my life.  I'm alright with a lot of the stereotypes that I face for my faith.  They often cause me to live to a higher standard.  One of the stereotypes that I feel that Mormons have is being boring or having a restrictive lifestyle.  I love living my life in such a way that surprises people of how much fun we can have and I would argue to be more fulfilling.</p>
    <p>In terms of lack of romantic relationships, this also causes people to think I must have some issues that make me weird or undesirable. I'm sure I have some degree of those characteristics, but no more than any other individual.</p>
    <p>Going into DBC, I think it will be important for me to view each individual for who they are and what I DO know about them--they have made a sacrifice in their life in order to be able to make a difference.  I think that is something that we can all unite on and move forward with.</p>
