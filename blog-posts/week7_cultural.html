    <p>If I had to pick two values that have made me the happiest, I would say Faith and Friendship.  When I have lived in a way where I am confident that I am living in accordance with God's will, then I find a sense a peace that is unmatched.</p>
    <p>Friendship goes hand in hand with family, but it is the relationships that I value when we share experiences together and I can't imagine loving others more than I love those individuals.  Sometimes I feel like I'm living in a dream and what I'm doing can't be real life it's simply so good.</p>
    <p>In asking how I live up to these values, I would rate myself a 4 on Faith and a 5 on Friendship.</p>
    <p>The last time someone asked me for advice, it was about one of their relationships or their future with schooling.  I feel that since one of my values is friendship it definitely relates to the issue that was at hand.  Their question itself wasn't about friendship, but the way I approached their questions and answers were in a way to provide them with friendship of my own. I've also been praying for one of my friends who has had trouble trying to discern his feelings on a relationship.</p>
    <p>When I think about my values I think it can help me negate some degree of stereotype threat, but much of the threat I often face deals with my faith so with that particular one I'm not sure how it would negate it.  However, at the same time, if I focus on my faith in the sense of love and forgiveness I think it will lower the threat.  Moreover, if I think of the value of friendship and what I would rather have come of the discussion is friendship rather than hostility I think that can also further lower the threat.</p>
    <p>In terms of making it through down times, I think I can focus on my faith in God.  This would include scriptures that remind me to trust in Him and Jesus Christ.  I can remember scriptures that teach of their love.  And lastly, I can remember the confidence of family and friends and the support they provide to me.</p>
