    <p>One of the best ways to be able to learn rapidly is to ask questions.  While it may seem like an easy thing to do, it is actually a skill that can accelerate your learning.</p>
    <p>I actually have some familiarity with the importance of asking the right questions.  My past job was a product specialist for a software company so I answered questions all day long.  Some common problems that I dealt with were (1) confusing wording, (2) incomplete questions, and (3) questions without a context.</p>
    <h3>Confusing Wording</h3>
    <p>If you have poor grammar, there's no other way to put this but you need to fix it or different way to ask your question so it is clear.  Aside from grammar, one of the main problems that causes confusing wording is the person doesn't even know what they want very clearly.  They may describe portions of the problem, but they can't get to the heart of the problem because they don't have a clear idea of what they are looking for.  So before you go asking a community of individuals, get a clear idea of what your question.</p>
    <h3>Incomplete Questions</h3>
    <p>There are many ways that you can make your question more complete.  Sometimes in trying to get to the point you omit information that is necessary for the question.  For example, if you have a constraint that forces you to do something in an atypical manner, make sure you include it.  Other things that are omitted are usually things that are assumed--the language that you are using, the type of project you are working on, or other simple components to your question that can make a big difference in how to approach the answer.  Make sure that your question is clear enough someone can walk into it and know exactly how to answer it.</p>
    <h3>Questions Without a Context</h3>
    <p>Sometimes you ask a question of how to do a particular thing, but if you put it into context someone would be able to point out to you that there is a far better way than the one you are using to approach the problem!  You may ask how to do a particular function, but if you gave an overview someone might point out a different function that will accomplish what you want even better.  Adding context allows someone to not only check to see the best way to approach your specific question, but the entire solution you have in mind as well.</p>
    <h3>Using Aids</h3>
    <p>Some important things to include are screenshots of what you have, code snippets, error messages or anything else that will allow someone to have a clearer picture (good pun?) of what you are trying to accomplish.  As the saying goes, sometimes a picture is worth a 1000 words so it can ask a lot of the question for you.</p>
    <p>As a summary, make sure to follow the "golden rule" reread your question and make sure it is asked in a way you would hope others would ask you.  This will help you get the best advice to move forward in the best ways.</p>
