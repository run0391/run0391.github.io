    <p>If you're looking into programming and web development, you have probably heard of Ruby and/or Ruby on Rails by now.  If you're like me, then you may have thought them to be one and the same.  Although Ruby and Ruby on Rails are connected they are different.  Ruby is a programming language and Rails is a framework.
    </p>
    <p>I'm going to make the assumption that you know what a programming language is, so let's talk about what a framework is.  A software framework is a universal, reusable software environment that provides particular functionality as part of a larger software platform to facilitate development of software applications, products and solutions.  While this may sound like a library to you, it is distinctly different from a library in a few ways.</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="unedited">In a framework, the flow of control is dictated by the framework, NOT by the caller.</li>
      <li class="unedited">Frameworks have a default behavior.</li>
      <li class="unedited">The framework can be extended or have selective overriding to provide specific functionality.</li>
      <li class="unedited">In general, the framework should be extended, not modified.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Thus, a framework allows you to implement a set of code that is going to already have some functionality that you can further work with; you don't have to worry about common configurations and you can focus on the specifics that are unique to your website.</p>
    <p>Two common elements that are emphasized in Rails are <b>Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY)</b> and <b>Convention over Configuration</b>.  DRY is relatively self-explanatory--you want to minimize the amount of code that you put in.  Convention over Configuration isn't quite as obvious, but what it means is that common configurations are automatically implemented so you only have to specify unconventional aspects.  For example, if you had a class called Students it would automatically create a table called <i>students</i>.  If you were to have something less conventional, such as <i>students passing</i>, then you would want to manually specify it.</p>
    <p>While this is not entirely comprehensive of Rails, hopefully it is clear how it works as a framework.  Further resources can be found below.</p>
