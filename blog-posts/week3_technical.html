Whether you know it or not, most of the websites that you use have some JavaScript.  JavaScript is popular because it allows you to have your website respond to the user in real-time.  You'll see this in social media with notifications, expanding the page, or performing calculations instantly as you type them in.

Some of the great things about JavaScript are that it is not overly difficult to learn, so a lot of programmers are able to use it.  It runs quickly so it won't slow down your website.  And what's not to love about having your website respond to you in real time?

While JavaScript is good for many things on a webpage, it cannot solve all problems.  When you need data saved to a computer, JavaScript won't be able to do that; if you want to protect your images from being downloaded, it won't be able to do that; if you want to have it access files from a different domain, it won't be able to do that.

As in all things, you should consider carefully the languages you use to set up your websites.  Any dynamic website will be using JavaScript, but make sure you evaluate all the components it will be able to help you with.
