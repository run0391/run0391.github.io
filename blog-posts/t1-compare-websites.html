    <p>The first site I went to is qualtrics.com, which is the company I currently work for.  In many ways, I chose this site because it is really the only one that I am regularly familiar with that is not a news source.  I think it has a pretty good structure where it fits into basically 3 screens as you scroll down, each one with a defined message and/or purpose through the content.</p>
    <p>My eyes usually notice the large image in the center that spans across.  I would describe it as modern, readable, rectangular, simplistic, and slightly-dated.</p>
    <p>The website solves the problem of what the software can provide you.  I would say it is very much informative, organized, themed, marketed, and straightforward. It's hard for me to really break apart the other adjectives from this one, as even 5 feels a bit insincere in labeling.  This site does sell something, but it is large licenses and is not something I would purchase as an individual.</p>
    <p>The next site I went to is Devour.com, which consists of a lot of popular YouTube videos. The site's purpose is largely to entertain, attract, appeal, sell, and screams attention. In terms of describing it, I would say it is modern, simple, organized, clean, and red-based.
    </p>
    <p>It's not too hard to find certain things, but if you were trying to find old things I'm not quite sure how easy it would be to find it.  It's not necessarily organized alphabetically, only cleanly.</p>
    <p>The last website is YouTube.  YouTube always catches your eye with the advertisements right at the top.  I would say it is energetic, active, catchy, loud, and personable.  Visually, I would say it is somewhat uniform, cluttered, graphic, and branded.</p>
    <p>It's pretty obvious YouTube's purpose is to entertain.  The amount of content is endless and can be hard to sift through everything if what you want is not necessarily the most popular thing, but overall it is good.</p>
